       <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <br/>
           <p><u>Year 0 - Circa 1965:</u>
            <br>
                 First Position was a group effort led by Scarlett Overkill.  Assisted my manager with various schemes to rule the world and conquer civilization.  This lasted for several years until her demise.</p>
            <br/>
           <p> <u>Circa 1965 - 2014:</u>
             <br>
                 My next endeavor was also a group effort led by Felonius Gru and his head project manager, Dr Nefario.  These were the most creative and challenging times of my career.  Such happiness and joy. The time I spent with this organization was the beginning of my love of Adventure and Base Concepts for Engineering and Project Work.</p>
             <br>
          <p><u> 2014 - 2017:</u>
             <br>
                 My Last association involved being kidnapped by an Evil Villian, Eduardo Perez, better known as "El Macho".  I was forced to participate in experimental injections creating an alternative persona of myself and fellow minions that eventually reek havoc on the entire world.  Luckily for me and my fellow colleagues, that organization failed miserably. </p>
