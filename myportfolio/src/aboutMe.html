			<h1><b><u>Mission</u></b></h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				Making YOUR work come to <strong>LIFE</strong>... <u>IS</u> my mission,
				plain and simple. It has always been my mission, my goal, in all that I
				do. From being the "Boss" to having a Boss, I stay the course for a
				successful outcome. Even volunteering at my children's schools, my goal
				is to help and make someone else's life better. I have always considered
				myself as the "<i>utility player</i>", a person that can wear any hat or
				play any position. Able to fit in any role to make the team work. I
				never back down from a challenge. It's not in my vocabulary...I'm from
				TEXAS. I'm the one that WILL make the square peg fit in the round hole.
				Now that's DETERMINATION!
