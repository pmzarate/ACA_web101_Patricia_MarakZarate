        <p>
            Making YOUR work come to <strong>LIFE</strong>... <u>IS</u> my mission,
            plain and simple. It has always been my mission, my goal, in all that I
            do. From being the "Boss" to having a Boss, I stay the course for a
            successful outcome. Even volunteering at my children's schools, my goal
            is to help and make someone else's life better. I have always considered
            myself as the "<i>utility player</i>", a person that can wear any hat or play
            any position. Able to fit in any role to make the team work. I never
            back down from a challenge. It's not in my vocabulary...I'm from TEXAS.
            I'm the one that WILL make the square peg fit in the round hole. Now
            THATS DETERMINATION! You have worked hard to get where you are and you
            need someone on your team helping you get noticed. I'm that person,
